# HealthInsuranceWebsite

When a person visits the site, he can visit the homepage to get information about what is health insurance and why is it needed. He can also visit other pages such as key benefits and contact details provided by the health insurance. <br />
In case if any person is interested to become a policy holder, he can register himself to be contacted by an health insurance agent.
On contacting the customer, the agent will inform him about the documents required for registration. After the registration the policy holder will get his unique ‘Username’ and ‘Password’ by the agent. <br />
Perfect confidentiality is maintained and only the user can view his reports using the username and password in customer login page.
Moreover the agent also updates his reports by adding the new customer id under his details.
Other people cant view the details of the customers and agents
<br /><br />
